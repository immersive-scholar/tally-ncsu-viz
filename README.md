## Notes

- Unity 2020.1, URP



## To do items




### Setup

- [x] Create repo
- [x] Create Unity project (2020.1.2f1)
- [x] [Git, Git LFS, SmartMerge](https://github.com/omundy/dig250-game-art-dev/blob/master/reference-sheets/Unity-Git.md)
- [ ] Choose a name!





### Data & Timeline

- [x] Data
	- [x] Update API with basic feed data
	- [x] Get Feed data in Unity
	- [x] Convert Feed data to JSON object
	- [x] Create EventManager
	- [x] Update API with detailed feed data
		- [x] Change format of feeds table to use `JSON_OBJECT()`
		- [x] Update feeds on website to use `eventData` object from each row
		- [x] Update API to use `eventData` object from each row
- [x] Timeline
	- [x] Timeline class
	- [x] Create playback
	- [x] Coroutine to play event at specific time




### Playback History and Buffer automation

- [ ] Create code that
	- [ ] Automatically gets, or handles a lack of, new events
	- [ ] Can consume data from the live API or local `JSON` files without changing anything
	- [ ] Potentially do it like:
		- [ ] Use two C# collections (either a List or Dictionary) named `buffer` and a `history` that can be sorted by a date string.
		- [ ] As the events are visualized, the event object is moved from the `buffer` to the `history`.
		- [ ] If no (or not enough) new events are found on the next API call, then a "rewind" can happen where a chunk of events from history are placed back in the buffer and the "playhead" can restart at the end of the buffer (until the next check).


### Timeline visualization

- [ ] Build timeline Visualization that shows `history` and `buffer` üëà
	- [ ] "Playhead" that moves horizontally with the current event
	- [ ] `History` and `buffer` are both visualized, with dots showing number in each collection, on either side
	- [ ] Playhead moves right as new events happen, increasing the `history` and decreasing the size of the `buffer`
	- [ ] As `buffer` is filled back up `history` is deleted and playhead resets to left.
	- [ ] Use [Colors](https://github.com/sneakaway-studio/tally-api/blob/master/public/assets/css/sass/custom.scss) from the website palette in the interface





### Interaction

- [ ] Add methods so viewer with a controller (keyboard, joystick, etc.) in the Visualization Studio **OR** someone using this with an iPad can: üëà
	- [ ] Use horiz/vert axis (controller) or pinch/zoom (tablet) to select different players
	- [ ] Click / press button / touch to zoom camera into and follow player
	- [ ] While zoomed-in, display additional data on that player (from feed, username, etc.)
	- [ ] Use horiz/vert axis (controller) or swipe (tablet) to shift to different player
	- [ ] Either after a period of no activity automatically, or with player click / press button to, zoom back out  


### Testing

- [ ] Build Feed data testing / monitor UI
	- [ ] Dropdown to switch between live / local
	- [x] Button: playback restart

## Documentation / Instructions

### Testing

- You can change the type of data to see either all data (mainly streams, but also game data) or feed (only game objects, which is more diverse). Select DataManager and change ‚ÄúChosen endpoint‚Äù to ‚ÄúRange plus stream 1 hour‚Äù or ‚ÄúRecent 20‚Äù (this is the more diverse game objects).
